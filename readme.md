### DAY 3

---

**Fork, Clone and Pull Request**

- **Fork** : is a copy of a repository in your own github account
- **Clone** : is to download the file/code in your desktop
- **pull request** : is a request to tell a remote user to pull the changes

**How it's work**

For Fork :

- go to remote repository which you need to access to your repository.
- then right size of the name of repository you got to see a Fork.
- click Fork and it's appear to your repository.

for clone which is Fork from remote:

- you got to see a green color button with code and download signal.
- click button and copy the url of that.
- open git bash and write "git clone (url of repository)".
- and then you can make change.

**remote url after fork**

- to check url name: **git remote -v**
- to add remote url name in your repository: **git remote add upsteam (url of remote repository)**.
  - this helps us to pull the change done by the remote repository after fork also if this is not done then we cann't.

for pull request:

- taking hover towards pull request and click it
- after clicking it you can see a pull request on green button
- pull request(click)--> create pull request(click)
- write title and message of request by summiting pull request

### Feedback

I would like to appreciate for your 3 days of the wonderful session on " Git and GitHub " provided by Mr. Milan Thapa, Senior Regional Officer at Genese Cloud Academy, from July 6 to July 8, 2020.

During this session, we got to learn about the differences between Git and GitHub, git workflow, installation, bash scripts, git technology (add, commit, pull, push, fetch, clone, fork) and there uses. Being an IT student this session is very fruitful and useful in our career. I must say this training session makes my knowledge more enhances and even makes us highly motivated.

I am really grateful to be part of this placement as a scholar, looking forward to attending this kind of productive class which boosts us to become more self-reliant, job holder, and entrepreneurs with the right soft and hard skills.

I would also like to thanks **genese cloud academy and Girls in tech** for providing us these kinds of classes which not only help us to improve but make our ability more strong and even  Mr. Milan Thapa, Senior Regional Officer at Genese Cloud Academy.  and volunteer for your valuable time and effort.
