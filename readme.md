**Git and GitHub**

- Git(2005) is maintained and installed on local system where GitHub(2008) is exclusively cloud-based(server).

**Git Workflow**

git init -------->WORKING DIRECTORY-------->git add ------->STAGING AREA-------->git commit----->REPOSITORY.

- working directory : (Additions, Deletion, Modifications).
- staging area : (Files are ready for commit).
- repository : (change are saved to repo).

**Some Bash Script**

- _mkdir_ : to make directory.
- _cd_ : Change directory.
- _ls_ : list directory.
- _file_ to create.
  1. _touch_ : create file.
  2. _echo_ : with message create file.
  3. _nano_ : with edit txt and create file.
- rm -R : Remove Files and directory.

**Git Terminology**

- **add** : add files and folder to staging.
- **commit** : create version/snapshot of repo.
- **push** : send files to remote.
- **fetch** : retrieve update information from remote.
- **pull**: retrieve updates from remote.
- **branch**: different section on same repository.
- **clone**: copy your repository.
- **fork**: copy other’s repo into your personal repo.

**More Git Command**

- **log** : track all command log.
  - eg : git log Or
  * git dif / diff --staged: Find the different between the staging and working directory.

**branch in git**

**more terminology**

- to check branch : **git branch**.
- to add branch : **git branch '<'branch name'>'**.
- to switch branch : **git checkout '<'branch name'>'**.
- to delete branch : **git branch -b '<'branch name'>'**.
- to merge branch : **git merge '<'branch name'>'**.

- shortcuts to create and switch to branch : **git checkout -b '<'branch name'>'**.

### DAY 3

---

**Fork, Clone and Pull Request**

- **Fork** : is a copy of a repository in your own github account
- **Clone** : is to download the file/code in your desktop
- **pull request** : is a request to tell a remote user to pull the changes

**How it's work**

For Fork :

- go to remote repository which you want to Fork.
- top-right corner of the page you find a fork, click Fork.
- Now, it's appear to your repository.

for clone which is Fork from remote:

- you got to see a green color button with code and download signal.
- click and copy the url of that.
- open git bash and write "git clone (url of repository)".
- Now, you can make change.

**remote url after fork**

- to check url name: **git remote -v**
- to add remote url name in your repository: **git remote add upsteam (url of remote repository)**.
  - this helps us to pull the change done by the remote repository after fork also if this is not done then we cann't.

for pull request:

- take hover towards pull request, click
- after clicking it you can see a pull request on green button, click
- create pull request, click
- write title and message of request and click pull request.

### Feedback

---

I would like to appreciate for your 3 days of the wonderful session on " Git and GitHub " provided by Mr. Milan Thapa, Senior Regional Officer at Genese Cloud Academy, from July 6 to July 8, 2020.

During this session, we got to learn about the differences between Git and GitHub, git workflow, installation, bash scripts, git technology (add, commit, pull, push, fetch, clone, fork) and their uses. Being an IT student this session is very fruitful and useful in our career. I must say this training session makes my knowledge more enhances and even makes us highly motivated.

I am really grateful to be part of this placement as a scholar, looking forward to attending this kind of productive class which boosts us to become more self-reliant, job holder, and entrepreneurs with the right soft and hard skills.

I would also like to thanks **genese cloud academy and Girls in tech** for providing us these kinds of classes which not only help us to improve but make our ability stronger and even  Mr. Milan Thapa, Senior Regional Officer at Genese Cloud Academy.  and volunteer for your valuable time and effort.
