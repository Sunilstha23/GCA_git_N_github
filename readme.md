### DAY 3

**Fork, Clone and Pull Request**

- **Fork** : is a copy of a repository in your own github account
- **Clone** : is to download the file/code in your desktop
- **pull request** : is a request to tell a remote user to pull the changes

**How it's work**

For Fork :

- go to remote repository which you need to access to your repository.
- then right size of the name of repository you got to see a Fork.
- click Fork and it's appear to your repository.

for clone which is Fork from remote:

- you got to see a green color button with code and download signal.
- click button and copy the url of that.
- open git bash and write "git clone (url of repository)".
- and then you can make change.

**remote url after fork**

- to check url name: **git remote -v**
- to add remote url name in your repository: **git remote add upsteam (url of remote repository)**.
  - this helps us to pull the change done by the remote repository after fork also if this is not done then we cann't.

for pull request:

- taking hover towards pull request and click it
- after clicking it you can see a pull request on green button
- pull request(click)--> create pull request(click)
- write title and message of request by summiting pull request
